## How to run

_Note: the assets were replaced by placeholders, so the version you will run locally is different in look than the version in stores._

### 1. Firebase Setup

It's important to put your own Firebase service file in order to run the app, as it uses Remote Config and Firebase Messaging.

1. Create a [new Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Add a new Android or iOS app, depending on which device you want to use, and follow the configuration steps to connect Noor to your Firebase project. This could help: https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup
3. Go to Remote Config page.
4. Add a new parameter with name `noorThker`, with any value of your choice.
5. Go to Cloud Messaging page, and enable it for your project.
6. To setup the cloud function that trigger a notification each time the Remote Config variable changes on the console, find the code in [this repo](https://github.com/Maryom/Noor_RemoteConfig).

> **NOTE:** You can't really run the app without it, so make sure to set it up.
>
> The app needs some files generated the `flutterfire_cli`, specifically `lib/firebase_options.dart`, `android/app/google-services.json`, and `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`.
>
> So make sure to follow the link in **step 2** if you haven't already.

### 2. (optional) FVM Setup

FVM is used to make sure everyone working on the project uses the same version. It is also easier to maintain since the `.fvmrc` file has the config you need to get started quickly.

It also makes it easy for **Noor** to stay on an older version without needing to do lots of upgrades and downgrades, since developers usually work on projects with different versions.

> FVM website: [https://fvm.app/](https://fvm.app/)

Once FVM is installed, run the following command to get things ready:

```
fvm use 3.22.1
```

> Be sure to check `.fvmrc` for the correct version this project uses, in case the version above is old.

### 3. Run

1. Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pr-Mais/noor.git
```

2. Get packages:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. (for android only) Edit the `android/app/build.gradle`:

This will allow you to sign the app with the debug keystore, no need to make a keystore just for development :D

```diff
- // signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
- signingConfig signingConfigs.release
+ signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
+ // signingConfig signingConfigs.release
```

1. Run:

```bash
flutter run
```
